## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `admin_state`:(bool)Enables or disables external FC storage configuration.
* `description`:(string)Description of the policy.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the concrete policy.
* `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional.
