# Data Source: intersight_connectorpack_upgrade_impact
Used to determine the list of connector packs to be installed on a target UCS Director in its next upgrade cycle. Accepts the moid of the target UcsdInfo as part of the filter query. Given below is a sample url :- https://{{target}}/api/v1/connectorpack/UpgradeImpacts?$filter=(UcsdInfo.Moid eq <<MoId>>).
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `class_id`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `is_eligible_for_upgrade`:(bool)"States whether the UCS Director is eligible for an upgrade. Set to true if connector packs are available for upgrade, else set to false."
* `is_update_downloaded`:(bool)"States whether all the requisite updates have been downloaded to the target UCS Director. Set to true if all connector packs required to upgrade UCS Director to the next iteration have been downloaded, else set to false."
* `moid`:(string)"The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance."
* `object_type`:(string)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
