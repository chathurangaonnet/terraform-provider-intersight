# Data Source: intersight_workflow._batch_api_executor
Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Batch API associates the list of API requests to be executed as part of single
task execution. Each API request takes the request body and a response parser

* `class_id`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `description`:(string) A detailed description about the batch APIs. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.

* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `retry_from_failed_api`:(bool) When an execution of a nth API in the Batch fails,Retry from falied API flag indicates if the execution should start from the nth API or the first API during task retry.By default the value is set to false. 
* `skip_on_condition`:(string) The skip expression, if provided, allows the batch API executor to skip thetask execution when the given expression evaluates to true.The expression is given as such a golang template that has to beevaluated to a final content true/false.
