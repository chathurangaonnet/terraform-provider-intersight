## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `class_id`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `file_content`:(string)"The content of the entire configuration file is stored as value. The content\ncan either be a static file content or a template content.\nThe template is expected to conform to the golang template syntax. The values\nfrom os.Answers properties will be used to populate this template."
* `moid`:(string)"The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance."
* `name`:(string)"The name of the OS ConfigurationFile that uniquely identifies the configuration file."
* `object_type`:(string)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
