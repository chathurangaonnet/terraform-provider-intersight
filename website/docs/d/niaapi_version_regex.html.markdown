# Data Source: intersight_niaapi_version_regex
The regular expression pattern to recongnize the version string.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `version`:(string)Version number for the Version Regex data, also used as identity.
