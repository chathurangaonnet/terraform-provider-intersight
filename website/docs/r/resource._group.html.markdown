# Resource: intersight_resource._group
A group of REST resources, such as a group of compute.Blade MOs. A ResourceGroup can contain static members which are specified as a set of object references, or it can contain dynamic members, which are specified through OData query filters. A Resource can be part of multiple resource groups.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)"A reference to a iamAccount resource.\nWhen the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `link`:(string)"A URL to an instance of the 'mo.MoRef' class."
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.\n1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.\n1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.\nAn error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `moid`:(string)"The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance."
* `name`:(string)"The name of this resource group."
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
* `organizations`:(Array)"An array of relationships to organizationOrganization resources."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `link`:(string)"A URL to an instance of the 'mo.MoRef' class."
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.\n1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.\n1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.\nAn error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `per_type_combined_selector`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `combined_selector`:(string)(Computed)"A single filter expression created by OR'ing the $filter criteria of the 'selectors'. Used to efficiently maintain the membership of the Group."
  + `empty_filter`:(bool)(Computed)"If true, then resources are added using just object type without filter."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `selector_object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The ObjectType on which the selectors are defined. Used to efficiently query resource groups for a given ObjectType."
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)"An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `link`:(string)"A URL to an instance of the 'mo.MoRef' class."
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."

* `qualifier`:(string)"Qualifier shall be used to specify if we want to organize resources using multiple resource group or single For an account, resource groups can be of only one of the above types. (Both the types are mutually exclusive for an account.)."
* `selectors`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."

  + `selector`:(string)"ODATA filter to select resources. The group selector may include URLs of individual resource, or OData query with filters that match multiple queries. The URLs must be relative (i.e. do not include the host)."
* `tags`:(Array)

  + `key`:(string)"The string representation of a tag key."
  + `value`:(string)"The string representation of a tag value."
