  Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.

# Resource: intersight_workflow._task_definition
Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a workflowCatalog resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `default_version`:(bool) When true this will be the task version that is used when a specific task definition version is not specified. The very first task definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the task definition as the default version. 
* `description`:(string) The task definition description to describe what this task will do when executed. 
* `implemented_tasks`:(Array) An array of relationships to workflowTaskDefinition resources.
