  Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.

# Resource: intersight_workflow_task_definition
Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -The catalog under which the definition has been added.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `default_version`:(bool)When true this will be the task version that is used when a specific task definition version is not specified. The very first task definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the task definition as the default version.
* `description`:(string)The task definition description to describe what this task will do when executed.
* `implemented_tasks`:(Array)List of all the implemented task for this TaskDefinition. When this list is populated it implies that this TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.

* `interface_task`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -A collection of references to the [workflow.TaskDefinition](mo://workflow.TaskDefinition) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [workflow.TaskDefinition](mo://workflow.TaskDefinition) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.

* `internal_properties`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)Type to capture all the internal properties for the task definition.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `base_task_type`:(string)(Computed)This field will hold the base task type like HttpBaseTask or RemoteAnsibleBaseTask.
  + `constraints`:(string)(Computed)This field will hold any constraints a concrete task definition will specify in order to limit the environment where the task can execute.
  + `internal`:(bool)(Computed)Denotes this is an internal task.  Internal tasks will be hidden from the UI within a workflow.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `owner`:(string)(Computed)The service that owns and is responsible for execution of the task.
* `label`:(string)A user friendly short name to identify the task definition.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)The name of the task definition. The name should follow this convention <Verb or Action><Category><Vendor><Product><Noun or object> Verb or Action is a required portion of the name and this must be part of the pre-approved verb list. Category is an optional field and this will refer to the broad category of the task referring to the type of resource or endpoint. If there is no specific category then use \"Generic\" if required. Vendor is an optional field and this will refer to the specific vendor this task applies to. If the task is generic and not tied to a vendor, then do not specify anything. Product is an optional field, this will contain the vendor product and model when desired. Noun or object is a required field and  this will contain the noun or object on which the action is being performed. Examples SendEmail  - This is a task in Generic category for sending email. NewStorageVolume - This is a vendor agnostic task under Storage device category for creating a new volume.
