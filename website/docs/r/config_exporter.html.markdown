# Resource: intersight_config._exporter
All export operations are captured as Exporter instances. Users shall use this Exporter
mo to track the export operation progress.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `download_path`:(string)(Computed) Pre-signed URL to download the exported package, if the export operation has completed successfully. Regenerated during a GET request, if the existing pre-signed URL has expired. 
* `exported_items`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to configExportedItem resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `items`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string) Moid represents the MoId of the object. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) An identifier for the exporter instance. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `status`:(string)(Computed) Status of the export operation. 
* `status_message`:(string)(Computed) Status message associated with failures or progress indication. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
