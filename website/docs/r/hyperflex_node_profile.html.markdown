# Resource: intersight_hyperflex._node_profile
A configuration profile per node in the HyperFlex cluster.
It defines node settings such as IP address configuration for hypervisor management network, storage data network, HyperFlex management network, and the assigned physical server.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `assigned_server`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a computeRackUnit resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `cluster_profile`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a hyperflexClusterProfile resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `description`:(string) Description of the profile. 
* `hxdp_data_ip`:(string) IP address for storage data network (Controller VM interface). 
* `hxdp_mgmt_ip`:(string) IP address for HyperFlex management network. 
* `hypervisor_data_ip`:(string) IP address for storage data network (Hypervisor interface). 
* `hypervisor_mgmt_ip`:(string) IP address for Hypervisor management network. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete profile. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `src_template`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a policyAbstractProfile resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `type`:(string) Defines the type of the profile. Accepted value is instance.
