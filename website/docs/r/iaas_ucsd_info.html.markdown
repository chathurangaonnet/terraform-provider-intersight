# Resource: intersight_iaas_ucsd_info
UCS Director accounts managed by Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `connector_pack`:(Array)(Computed)"Relationship to a collection of connector packs installed on the UCSD."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.\n1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.\n1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.\nAn error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `device_id`:(string)(Computed)"Moid of the UCS Director device connector's asset.DeviceRegistration."
* `device_status`:(Array)(Computed)"Relationship to a collection of infra accounts managed by the UCSD."
