# Resource: intersight_capability._switch_capability
Type to represent additional switch specific capabilities.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `dynamic_vifs_supported`:(bool) Dynamic VIFs support on this switch. 
* `fan_modules_supported`:(bool) Fan Modules support on this switch. 
* `fc_end_host_mode_reserved_vsans`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `end_port_id`:(int) Ending Port ID in this range of ports. 
  + `end_slot_id`:(int) Ending Slot ID in this range of ports.
