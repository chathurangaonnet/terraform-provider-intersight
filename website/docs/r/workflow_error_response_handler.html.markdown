  Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Error Response Handler allows to create a generic error response specification
which can be used by multiple Batch API. The parameters provided in the Error
Response Handler may be used to parse error responses from an API request, if
the response specification provided for the API request does not define
error parameters.

# Resource: intersight_workflow._error_response_handler
Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Error Response Handler allows to create a generic error response specification
which can be used by multiple Batch API. The parameters provided in the Error
Response Handler may be used to parse error responses from an API request, if
the response specification provided for the API request does not define
error parameters.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a workflowCatalog resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `description`:(string) A detailed description about the error response handler. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name for the error response handler. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `parameters`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `accept_single_value`:(bool) The flag that allows single values in content to be extracted as asingle element collection in case the parameter is of Collection type.This flag is applicable for parameters of type Collection only. 
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `complex_type`:(string) The name of the complex type definition in case this is a complexparameter. The content.Grammar object must have a complex type, content.ComplexType,defined with the specified name in types collection property. 
  + `item_type`:(string) The type of the collection item in case this is a collection parameter. 
  + `name`:(string) The name of the parameter. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `path`:(string) The content specific path information that identifies the parametervalue within the content. The value is usually a XPath or JSONPath or aregular expression in case of text content. 
  + `type`:(string) The type of the parameter. Accepted values are simple, complex,collection. 
* `platform_type`:(string) The platform type for which the error response handler is defined. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `types`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `name`:(string) The unique name of this complex type within the grammar specification. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `parameters`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `accept_single_value`:(bool) The flag that allows single values in content to be extracted as asingle element collection in case the parameter is of Collection type.This flag is applicable for parameters of type Collection only. 
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
    + `complex_type`:(string) The name of the complex type definition in case this is a complexparameter. The content.Grammar object must have a complex type, content.ComplexType,defined with the specified name in types collection property. 
    + `item_type`:(string) The type of the collection item in case this is a collection parameter. 
    + `name`:(string) The name of the parameter. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
    + `path`:(string) The content specific path information that identifies the parametervalue within the content. The value is usually a XPath or JSONPath or aregular expression in case of text content. 
    + `type`:(string) The type of the parameter. Accepted values are simple, complex,collection.
