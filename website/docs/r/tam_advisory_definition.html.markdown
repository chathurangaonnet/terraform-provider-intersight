An Intersight Advisory. An advisory represents an identification of a potential issue and may also include  a recommendation for resolving the said issue. Advisories may be of different kind and severity. for e.g. It could be a security vulnerability or a performance issue or a hardware issue with different recommendations for resolving them.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `actions`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `affected_object_type`:(string) Type of the managed object that should be marked with an instance of the Alert (when operation type is create) or that should have an alert instance removed (when operation type is remove). 
  + `alert_type`:(string) Alert type is used to denote the category of an Intersight alert (FieldNotice, equipment Fault etc.). 
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `identifiers`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
    + `name`:(string) Name of the filter paramter. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
    + `value`:(string) Value of the filter paramter. 
  + `name`:(string) Uniquely identifies a given action among the set of actions corresponding to an advisory. Primarily used to store and compare results of subsequent iterations corresponding to the action queries. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `operation_type`:(string) Operation type for the alert action. An action is used to carry out the process of \ reacting\  to an alert condition. For e.g.in case of a fieldNotice alert, the intention may be to create a new alert (if the condition matches and there is no existing alert) or to remove an existing alert when the alert condition has been remedied. 
  + `queries`:(Array)

The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
    + `priority`:(int) An integer value depicting the priority of the query among the queries that are part of the same QueryEntry collection.
