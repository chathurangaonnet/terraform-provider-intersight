# Resource: intersight_vnic._eth_if
Virtual Ethernet Interface.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `cdn`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Consistent Device Naming configuration for the virtual NIC. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `source`:(string) Source of the CDN. It can either be user specified or be the same as the vNIC name. 
  + `value`:(string) The CDN value entered in case of user defined mode. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `eth_adapter_policy`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a vnicEthAdapterPolicy resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous.
