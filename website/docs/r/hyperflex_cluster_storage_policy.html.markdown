# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_cluster_storage_policy
A policy specifying HyperFlex cluster storage settings (optional).

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array)List of cluster profiles using this policy.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `description`:(string)Description of the policy.
* `disk_partition_cleanup`:(bool)If enabled, formats existing disk partitions (destroys all user data).
* `logical_avalability_zone_config`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Enable or disable Logical Availability Zones (LAZ). If enabled, HyperFlex Data Platform automatically selects and groups nodes into different availability zones. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting does not apply. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, this setting is only applicable to Fabric Interconnect attached HyperFlex systems with 8 or more converged nodes.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `auto_config`:(bool)Enable or disable Logical Availability Zones (LAZ).If enabled, HyperFlex Data Platform automatically selects and groups nodes into different availability zones. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting does not apply. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, this setting is only applicable to Fabric Interconnect attached HyperFlex systems with 8 or more converged nodes.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the concrete policy.
* `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Relationship to the Organization that owns the Managed Object.

* `tags`:(Array)The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)The string representation of a tag key.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `value`:(string)The string representation of a tag value.
* `vdi_optimization`:(bool)Enable or disable VDI optimization (hybrid HyperFlex systems only).
