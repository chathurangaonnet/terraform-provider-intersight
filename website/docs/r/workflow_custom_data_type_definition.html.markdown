# Resource: intersight_workflow._custom_data_type_definition
Captures a customized data type definition that can be used for task or workflow input/output.  This can be reused across multiple tasks and workflow definitions.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a workflowCatalog resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `composite_type`:(bool) When true this data type definition is a collection of type definitions to represent composite data like JSON. 
* `description`:(string) A human-friendly description of this custom data type indicating it's domain and usage. 
* `label`:(string) A user friendly short name to identify the custom data type definition. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name of custom data type definition. The valid name can contain lower case and upper case alphabetic characters, degits and special characters '-' and '_'. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `type_definition`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `default`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:

The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
    + `override`:(bool) Override the default value provided for the data type. When true, allow the user to enter value for the data type. 
    + `value`: Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input. 
  + `description`:(string) Provide a detailed description of the data type. 
  + `label`:(string) Descriptive label for the data type. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), space ( ) or an underscore (_). The first and last character in label must be an alphanumeric character. 
  + `name`:(string) Descriptive name for the data type. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-) or an underscore (_). The first and last character in name must be an alphanumeric character. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `required`:(bool) Specifies whether this parameter is required. The field is applicable for task and workflow.
