# Resource: intersight_virtualization._virtual_machine
Depicts operations to control the life cycle of a VM on a Hypervisor.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `action`:(string) Action to be performed on a virtual machine (Create, PowerState, Migrate, Clone etc). 
* `action_info`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) Details of an action performed on the virtul machine. Contains name of the action performed, status, failure reason message etc. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value.
