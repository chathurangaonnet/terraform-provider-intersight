# Resource: intersight_smtp._policy
Name that identifies the SMTP Policy.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `enabled`:(bool) If enabled, controls the state of the SMTP client service on the managed device. 
* `min_severity`:(string) Minimum fault severity level to receive email notifications. Email notifications are sent for all faults whose severity is equal to or greater than the chosen level. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.

* `sender_email`:(string) The email address entered here will be displayed as the from address (mail received from address) of all the SMTP mail alerts that are received. If not configured, the hostname of the server is used in the from address field. 
* `smtp_port`:(int) Port number used by the SMTP server for outgoing SMTP communication. 
* `smtp_recipients`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `smtp_server`:(string) IP address or hostname of the SMTP server. The SMTP server is used by the managed device to send email notifications. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
