# Resource: intersight_workflow._workflow_info
Contains information for a workflow execution which is a runtime instance of workflow.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `action`:(string) The action of the workflow such as start, cancel, retry, pause. 
* `associated_object`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
