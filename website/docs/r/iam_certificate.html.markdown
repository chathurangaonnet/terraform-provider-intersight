# Resource: intersight_iam._certificate
Holds a certificate, signed by a CAcert.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `certificate`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - User-input pem-encoded certificate, signed by a CAcert. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `issuer`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the issuer of this certificate. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
    + `common_name`:(string)(Computed) A required component that identifies a person or an object. 
    + `country`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `locality`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
    + `organization`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `organizational_unit`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `state`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `pem_certificate`:(string) The base64 encoded certificate in PEM format. 
  + `sha256_fingerprint`:(string)(Computed) The computed SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate. Equivalent to 'openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256'. 
  + `signature_algorithm`:(string)(Computed) Signature algorithm, as specified in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). 
  + `subject`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the subject of this certificate. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
    + `common_name`:(string)(Computed) A required component that identifies a person or an object. 
    + `country`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `locality`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
    + `organization`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `organizational_unit`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `state`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `certificate_request`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamCertificateRequest resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `status`:(string)(Computed) Status of the certificate. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
