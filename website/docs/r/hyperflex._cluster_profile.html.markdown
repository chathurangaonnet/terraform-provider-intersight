# Resource: intersight_hyperflex._cluster_profile
A profile specifying configuration settings for a HyperFlex cluster.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `action`:(string)"User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign."
