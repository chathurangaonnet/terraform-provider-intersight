# Resource: intersight_iam_account
The Intersight Account used to access Intersight.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `domain_groups`:(Array)(Computed)The domain Groups are configured in an account for scaling purpose. Currently, only onboarding-device account has multiple domain groups and other accounts have only one domain group per account.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `end_point_roles`:(Array)(Computed)User defined end point roles. These roles are assigned to Intersight users to perform end point operations such as GUI/CLI cross launch.
