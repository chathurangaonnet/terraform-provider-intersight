# Resource: intersight_vnic_fc_adapter_policy
A Fibre Channel Adapter policy governs the host-side behavior of the adapter, including how the adapter handles traffic. You can enable FCP Error Recovery, change the default settings of Queues and Interrupt handling for performance enhancement.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `description`:(string)"Description of the policy."
* `error_detection_timeout`:(int)"Error Detection Timeout, also referred to as EDTOV, is the number of milliseconds to wait before the system assumes that an error has occurred."
* `error_recovery_settings`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"Fibre Channel Error Recovery Settings."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `enabled`:(bool)"Enables Fibre Channel Error recovery."

  + `io_retry_timeout`:(int)"The number of seconds the adapter waits before aborting the pending command and resending the same IO request."
  + `link_down_timeout`:(int)"The number of milliseconds the port should actually be down before it is marked down and fabric connectivity is lost."
