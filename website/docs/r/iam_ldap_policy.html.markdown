# Resource: intersight_iam_ldap_policy
LDAP Policy configurations.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `base_properties`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Base settings of LDAP required while configuring LDAP policy.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `attribute`:(string)Role and locale information of the user.
  + `base_dn`:(string)Base Distinguished Name (DN). Starting point from where server will search for users and groups.
  + `bind_dn`:(string)Distinguished Name (DN) of the user, that is used to authenticate against LDAP servers.
  + `bind_method`:(string)Authentication method to access LDAP servers.
  + `domain`:(string)The IPv4 domain that all users must be in.
  + `enable_encryption`:(bool)If enabled, the endpoint encrypts all information it sends to the LDAP server.
  + `enable_group_authorization`:(bool)If enabled, user authorization is also done at the group level for LDAP users not in the local user database.
  + `filter`:(string)Criteria to identify entries in search requests.
  + `group_attribute`:(string)Groups to which an LDAP entry belongs.
  + `is_password_set`:(bool)(Computed)
  + `nested_group_search_depth`:(int)Search depth to look for a nested LDAP group in an LDAP group map.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `password`:(string)Password of the user, that is used to authenticate.
  + `timeout`:(int)LDAP authentication timeout duration, in seconds.
* `dns_parameters`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Configuration settings to resolve LDAP servers, when DNS is enabled.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `search_domain`:(string)Domain name that acts as a source for a DNS query.
  + `search_forest`:(string)Forest name that acts as a source for a DNS query.
  + `source`:(string)Source of the domain name used for the DNS SRV request.
* `description`:(string)Description of the policy.
* `enable_dns`:(bool)Enables DNS to access LDAP servers.
* `enabled`:(bool)LDAP server performs authentication.
* `groups`:(Array)Relationship to collection of LDAP Groups.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the concrete policy.
* `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Relationship to the Organization that owns the Managed Object.
