# Resource: intersight_workflow._batch_api_executor
Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Batch API associates the list of API requests to be executed as part of single
task execution. Each API request takes the request body and a response parser
specification.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `batch`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `body`:(string) The optional request body that is sent as part of this API request.The request body can contain a golang template that can be populated with task inputparameters and previous API output parameters. 
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `content_type`:(string) Intersight Orchestrator, with the support of response parser specification,can extract the values from API responses and map them to task output parameters.The value extraction is supported for response content types XML and JSON.The type of the content that gets passed as payload and response in thisAPI. 
  + `name`:(string) A reference name for this API request within the batch API request.This name shall be used to map the API output parameters to subsequentAPI input parameters within a batch API task. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `outcomes`: All the possible outcomes of this API are captured here. Outcomes propertyis a collection property of type workflow.Outcome objects.The outcomes can be mapped to the message to be shown. The outcomes areevaluated in the order they are given. At the end of the outcomes list,an catchall success/fail outcome can be added with condition as 'true'.This is an optionalproperty and if not specified the task will be marked as success. 
  + `response_spec`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - The optional grammar specification for parsing the response to extract therequired values.The specification should have extraction specification specified forall the API output parameters.
