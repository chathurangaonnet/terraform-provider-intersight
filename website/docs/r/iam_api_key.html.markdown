API keys are used to programatically perform API calls. API keys can be created by passing purpose field, which is a description for the application using API keys. Maximum of 3 API keys per user is allowed. API key will have RSA key pair generated and as part of create request key MOID, private and public key in PEM format are returned. In Intersight only the public key is stored. Client side private key is stored and is used for signature calculation. API key requests are authenticated using RSA SHA 256 signature validations. If the incoming request for authorization has X-Starship-Token, then session based authorization is done, else API key based authorization is performed. Once User, API key and Account are found and signature verification succeeds, then the privilege validations are performed.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `permission`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)Permissions associated with the API key. Permission provides a way to assign roles to a user or user group to perform operations on object hierarchy.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `private_key`:(string)Holds the private key for the API key.
* `purpose`:(string)The purpose of the API Key.
* `tags`:(Array)The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)The string representation of a tag key.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `value`:(string)The string representation of a tag value.
* `user`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)A collection of references to the [iam.User](mo://iam.User) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.User](mo://iam.User) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.
